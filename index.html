    <h1>The Small Space of a Pause</h1>

<p>
Before I start explaining what the Memory Theatre is, it’s necessarily to first explain how I got (t)here. The structure of the Memory Theatre, my thesis, originated from the need to understand my own practice. During the four year programme at the academy, my choice for Graphic Design has been questioned over and over again. Not just by the tutors. I couldn’t justify it either. In whatever surface you wrap it, Graphic Design is communication. My work is too abstract. Too hermetic. It doesn’t communicate. I don’t communicate. To some extent I’ve always understood this doubt. But with this understanding was also my reasoning that communication is in everything. Whether with awareness or without. With intent or without. It’s communication from the creator’s perspective, mine in this case, but also from the viewer’s perspective.

My initial topic for this thesis was poetics. I wanted to understand my work through understanding the meaning of “poetic” and all the qualities and implications related to this word. A quality that has been attached to my work by other people for years, without any substantial explanation. This word has become a synonym to “it’s mysterious”, “it’s beautiful, but I have no clue what it means”, “you know, that feeling. But actually, I don’t know” and “I don’t understand it”. That’s how I would describe poetry. And my work too, perhaps. At the end of the third year I finally got a description that made sense, something I could actually work with. Poetic is transformative.

For years I have been certain that any (random) topic can be explained through any other (random) topic. A creative thinker should be able to go through the process of literally “comparing apples to oranges” and coming out on the other side having a better understanding of what apples are. But also a better understanding of what oranges are. And in the process understanding that it’s actually not (just) about apples. Neither is it (just) about oranges. It’s about something abstract. About something universal. This is what I consider the essence of perception and knowledge. This believe is almost fundamental, I would say, in my practice and foremost in my motivation to create. And this might explain why considering a, to me, unfamiliar topic as poetic, to understand my own work, is not that random at all.

Although I do understand there is a difference between poetry and the adjective poetic, I started my research with reading up on theory on poetry. The first thing I noticed, was the similarities between the history of poetry and the history of art. I felt like I had replaced the word art, or graphic design for that matter, for the word poetry. Not surprising of course, both are creations by humans, with human experience as input after all. But the understanding of this has been reinforced over and over again throughout my research and even more during the writing of this thesis. To understand something is not the same as understanding the objective reality of that something. Through one experience after another (time) I am able to get a more grounded understanding. Grounded within me. But this also makes me realise that I will never be able to comprehend the full understanding, the reality.

“I know that I know nothing.” The Socratic paradox

If the development of poetry, art and graphic design is influenced by human experience, then the development of my own practice is influenced by my own experiences. Again, this is not surprising. And again the understanding, or awareness, of this is even being more reinforced while I’m writing this. Experiencing this. This thesis is an expression of the process I went through. Whether the beginning started with me deciding on the topic, or deciding to apply for Graphic Design or even the time my mom deciding to give birth to me is up to debate. And if you believe in previous lives and that everything comes from the one thing, then the beginning of this, this moment, this thesis, me, us as human beings, is equal to the beginning of time.
